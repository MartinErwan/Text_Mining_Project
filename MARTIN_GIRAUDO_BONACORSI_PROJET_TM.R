#Cleaning the data: write the R code and show an example in which you apply it to a subset of the data.

#CLEANING FUNCTION TO CLEAN A CORPUS

cleaning = function(corpus){
  #Remove suppercase 
  corpus = tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
  #Remove punctuation
  corpus = tm_map(corpus,removePunctuation)
  #Remove stopwords
  stw = stopwords("english")
  corpus = tm_map(corpus,removeWords,stopwords("english"))
  corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers)

#Example of application

#Cleaning

#II.A) Show the high dimensionality and sparsity of the data.

sparsity
#We have a parsimony of 99.6% which shows the sparsity of the data ==> 99.6% of the coefficients of the word matrix are zero

#II.B) Select some topics in both training and test sets and represent them by wordclouds. Comment the result.

#Function to display the wordcloud of a corpus

#Training Wordcloud
wc(data_trade_training)

#Test Wordcloud
wc(data_trade_test)

#We notice that words "trade","said","japan","japanese","washington"
#So we have a certain similarity between the wordcloud of the training set and the wordcloud of the testing set

#NB: Pictures are saved in the folder for a better vizualisation.

#Wordcloud example 2 : Topic ship

#Training set wordcloud

#So we have some similarity between the wordcloud of the training set and the testing set

#NOTE: The images are saved in the folder for better visualization
#We notice again the recurrence of words in the 2 sets: vessels,said,spokesman,ship,foreign...

#==> We can then say that the occurrence of some words can allow to determinate the class of a document
#II.C) Using a subset of your data, represent each document as a vector of TF-IDF values and

#Retrieval of the tf_idf vector of the document (here the document number 1 of the corpus)

#Example 2 : Similarity of a document with a document belonging to the same class 

#Retrieval of tf_idf vectors of documents to compare
#Here we will compare document 1 to document 2 (which belongs to the same class "trade" according to the construction of the corpus (the first 369 are of the class trade)
